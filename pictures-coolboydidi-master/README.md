# Week 5 Day 3: Pictures Mini-Lab

In class today, we'll be doing some practice with 2D arrays with a real-world application: image manipulation!

<br />

Add code to [Picture.java](src/main/java/Picture.java), and then test your code by running the main method in [Picture.java](src/main/java/Picture.java) file. 

## Run your code with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [Picture.java](src/main/java/Picture.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make run
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew run
```

## Run your tests with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [MyTests.java](src/test/java/MyTests.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make test
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew test
```
